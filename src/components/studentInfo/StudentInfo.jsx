          Student registration for Evening with Industry 2024 will open in January. Table assignments are first come, first serve, so be on the lookout to ensure you get to sit with your top choice company! Prices also increase every week, so you donâ€™t want to miss out on the early bird discounts.

          If the cost of EWI is a barrier for you, please do not hesitate to contact us about discounted pricing options. We would love to have you at our event and want to ensure that financial aid is available to those who need it.
